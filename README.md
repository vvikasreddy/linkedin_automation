 
## Linkedin Referral automation.

### Prerequisites
To run this project, youâ€™ll need the following:
- **Google Chrome Browser**: Ensure Chrome is installed on your system.
- **Login Credentials**: Log in to the target website using your username and password in Chrome before proceeding.

### Setup Instructions
1. **Install Selenium**:
   - Ensure Python is installed, then install the Selenium package via pip:
     ```
     pip install selenium
     ```

2. **Launch Chrome with Remote Debugging**:
   - Open the Command Prompt (CMD) on your system.
   - Run the following command to start Chrome with remote debugging enabled:
     ```
     "C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --remote-debugging-port=9222
     ```
   - This allows the Selenium script to interact with your logged-in Chrome session.

3. **Run the Demo**:
   - Open the `demo.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
   - Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to run the script.

Now the Selenium installation comes first, followed by launching Chrome, and then running the demo. Let me know if you need further tweaks!
