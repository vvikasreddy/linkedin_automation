I\u2019ve containerized services with Docker on AWS and applied NLP to healthcare datasets to drive better patient insights.\n\nCould we schedule a 10-minute chat next week to discuss the role and Somatus\u2019s priorities?\n\nRegards, \nVikas Reddy. \nPortfolio : https://vvikasreddy.github.io/\nGitHub: https://github.com/vvikasreddy/",
