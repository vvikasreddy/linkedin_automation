I\u2019m currently pursuing my Master\u2019s in Data Science at UMBC (GPA 4.0), and I\u2019ve had hands-on experience with data cleaning, analysis, and dashboarding both in academic research and during my internship at EPAM Systems. I\u2019m comfortable working with Python, SQL, and tools like Tableau, and I really enjoy turning raw data into clear, actionable insights.\n\nWhat sets me apart is my ability to work across teams and simplify technical findings for non-technical audiences\u2014something I\u2019ve done while building emotion recognition tools and automating QA processes. I\u2019m eager to bring that same energy and clarity to your team.\n\nBelow I am attaching my resume, and a recommendation letter from my professor where I worked as a Research Assistant. \n\nThanks for considering my application.
